# WhatHot

**Whathot** is an mobile application built with react-native.


Installation && run
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run ios
```

## What did i use?

- **Typescript**: for adding type definition to the project.

- **Styled-components** for styling.

- **React-Navigation**: to navigate between components.

- **React-Query**: for state management and data fetching, i used react-query. Handling asynchronous http request with react-query made my code not only effective but easy to read.
